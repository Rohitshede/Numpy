# NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these elements. NumPy is a cornerstone in the Python data science ecosystem and is widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, finance, and machine learning.

## Key Features of NumPy:

- **N-dimensional Arrays:** NumPy introduces the `numpy.ndarray` object, which represents a homogeneous, multi-dimensional array of elements.

- **Broadcasting:** NumPy allows for the broadcasting of functions across arrays of different shapes and sizes, enabling efficient computation on large datasets.

- **Mathematical Functions:** The library includes a rich set of mathematical functions for linear algebra, Fourier analysis, random number generation, and more.

- **Integration with Other Languages:** NumPy provides tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.
